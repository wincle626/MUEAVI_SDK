 *  This file contains the class for object detection
 *  through the image from PTZ camera. 
 *
 *  The imgdet class is a wrapper of darknet calling all
 *  the necessary function calls for MUEAVI object detection. 
 *  The major steps of imgdet includes:
 *  1. extract ROI
 *     (we need to define the ROI)
 *  2. detect the object
 *     (we need to define the object)
 *  3. output object information 
 *     (we need to define the information format)
